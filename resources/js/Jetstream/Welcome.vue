                The Tracing the Potter’s Wheel project is designed to identify and assess the appearance of the potter’s wheel as a technological innovation within the Bronze Age Aegean (2500-1200 BC). Our approach uses the potter’s wheel as prism through which to investigate the transmission of craft knowledge during this exciting period of social, cultural and technological development, and consider the ways Aegean (potting) communities were configured and connected through time.
