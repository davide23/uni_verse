The 4DFWD features a 3D-printed midsole with a distinct “4D” bowtie-lattice pattern design to convert a runner’s vertical forces into forward motion. At the same time, it reduces braking forces while increasing cushioning by 23 percent to allow for more comfortable, longer runs.</p><p>In collaboration with the team at @tbwaneboko we designed the technical graphics, main campaign image and animation for the new #adidas4DFWD running shoe.</p><p>In the resulting key visual and animation we see the extreme flex of the sole compressing and shearing under pressure. A flow of arrows helps represent how downward pressure on the sole results in forward motion as well as leaving a ‘sheared state’ sole behind.</p><p>These assets are used in an array of different outputs such as print, online, video and animation. A good example of that is our assets being used in the campaign film by @buildersclub_london</p><p>Thanks to the team at @tbwaneboko for trusting us with this as well as @buildersclub_london and all the other collaborators who took part in this campaign.</p><p>UNI_VERSE<br />Creative/Art Director: @jeffbeukema<br />Producer: @daanschraauwers<br />Design: @joan_moreno_o<br />3D Animation: @geertvanhooff <br />@terphilippe<br />3D Modelling: @timvanhelsdingen @andreferwerda @bermudizmo<br />Campaign Video: @buildersclub_london</p><p>Keep moving forward!</p>",

An prominent installation from the Stedelijk collection is TV-Buddha (1974), in which an 18th-century wooden Buddha appears to ‘watch’ itself on a modern television, and typifies the influence of (Zen) Buddhist philosophies on Paik’s approach to art and technology. Also on view is TV garden (1974-77), an installation with TV sets alongside living plants. Paik imagined a futuristic landscape where technology is an integral part of the natural world.We brought to live in AR the iconic TV Garden on the Museumplein, in the central hall and the TV Buddha on flyers. People could scan the QR code wich brings you to the Instagram filter, scan the poster and the art appears.</p><p>We also created several promotional videos for social.<a href='https://www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/nam-june-paik' target='_blank'>www.stedelijk.nl/en/exhibitions/nam-june-paik</a></p><p>Stedelijk Museum<br />Interim Marketing <br />Director: Natalie Bos<br />Content Manager: Femke Pijls<br />Traffic Coördinator: Merel de Zeeuw<br />Art Director: Ines Cox</p><p>UNI_VERSE<br />Creative Director: Jeff Beukema<br />3D/AR Artists: Terence de Vries, Ruolan Xi, Isabelle Udo<br />Executive Producer: Daan Schraauwers</p>",
